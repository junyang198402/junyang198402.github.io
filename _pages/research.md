# Outline of main research interests:
My research encompasses a comprehensive exploration into advanced control theory, intricate motion planning, and their pragmatic applications. Specifically, the foci are:

## Advanced Control Theory
Fundamental contributions have been made in disturbance observer-based control, sliding mode control, model predictive control, in particular in the area of unmatched disturbance compensation.

## Motion Planning and Control:
Multiple disturbance modeling and estimation, key parameter identification, visual serving control, vibration suppression, motion planning, path following.

## Applications:
AC motor and drives, container crane, power electronics, industrial robots, inertial stabilization platform, and unmanned aerial vehicles.
