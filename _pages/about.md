Dr Yang is currently a Reader in Mechatronic and Autonomous Systems in the [Department of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/aae/) (AAE) at Loughborough University (LU). Prior to joining LU, he was a full professor in control systems at Southeast University (SEU), Nanjing, China. Jun served as Head of Department of Automation (2018-2020), Vice-Director of Mechatronics Systems Control Lab in SEU (2012-2020), Co-founder and Vice-Chairman of Nanjing Chapter of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (2018-now). 

He obtained his BSc in Automation from School of Information Science and Engineering at Northeastern University, China in 2006 and subsequently his PhD in Control Engineering from School of Automation at Southeast University, China in 2011. He once held various academic visiting positions worldwide like Visiting Professor at Imperial College London (UK, 2019), Visiting Associate Professor at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore, 2016), and Visiting Research Fellows at RMIT University (Australia, 2015) and Western University of Sydney (Australia, 2013).

He was elevated as an IEEE Fellow in 2022, an AAIA Fellow in 2022, and an IET Fellow in 2020 for contributions in disturbance observer-based control (DOBC) and its applications to mechatronic and robotic systems. Jun was listed as one of the Worldâ€™s Top 2% Scientists from 2020 and 2023 by Stanford University and the Highly Cited Chinese Researcher in 2020 by Elsevier. He won the EPSRC New Investigator Award (on optimisation and control of electric machines for electric vehicle applications) in 2022, and the National Young Talent Fellowship of China in 2018, which is one of the most prestigious personal awards for young academics in China. Jun was also a winner of Gold Medal of International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva in 2022. 

One of his published papers (DOI: 10.1109/TIE.2015.2478397) on an overview of DOBC was elected as the Most Popular Articles of IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics since 2016. His paper on advanced disturbance rejection control of power electronic systems won the Premium Award for best paper of IET Control Theory and Applications in 2017 (doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2014.0220). Junâ€™s research works on fundamental disturbance rejection control won the Annual ICI Prize for best paper of Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control (TIMC) in 2016 (DOI: 10.1177/0142331213499182), and the Most Cited Automatica Articles (2012-2017, doi.org/10.1016/j.automatica.2013.03.026). He serves as a Technical Editor of IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics since 2021, Associate Editors of IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics since 2022, which are the flagship journals in mechanical, electrical engineering, and control systems.  

His general research interests lie in advanced modelling and analysis, learning and estimation, optimisation and control methods that improve performance, efficiency, functionality, and safety of mechatronic and autonomous systems.
